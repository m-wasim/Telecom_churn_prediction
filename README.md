# Telecom_churn_prediction
The churn rate, also known as the rate of attrition or customer churn, is the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. It is most commonly expressed as the percentage of service subscribers who discontinue their subscriptions within a given time period.
For Telecom companies it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations (=churn) to grow their revenue generating base.
